# 👋 Hello, I'm Dave Xiao!
I'm diving into the world of machine learning as a hobby, exploring topics like latent representations, transformers, and reinforcement learning with an emphasis on reward-based models. Driven by curiosity, I'm expanding my understanding through online tutorials, Coursera courses, and research papers.

### 🎯 Objective
My goal is to deepen my knowledge in machine learning and apply it creatively to solve interesting problems. I enjoy experimenting and learning about complex systems and how they can be used to develop intelligent applications.

### 🛠️ Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- 
- **ML & Data Science Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- 
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- 
- **Additional Experience:** Frontend and Backend development

### 🌱 Current Learning Focus
- **Latent Representations:** Exploring how to represent complex data in lower-dimensional spaces that retain meaningful patterns and features. This involves understanding how autoencoders, embeddings, and dimensionality reduction techniques can simplify and enhance data interpretation in various machine learning applications.
  
- **Transformers:** Delving into the transformer architecture to learn how it captures sequence information and context in data. My focus is on understanding the core mechanisms like self-attention and positional encoding, as well as practical applications in tasks such as natural language processing, sequence prediction, and even reinforcement learning.

- **Reward-Defined Reinforcement Learning:** Investigating reinforcement learning with a focus on defining and optimizing reward structures to guide agent behavior. I'm particularly interested in learning how rewards impact decision-making in RL algorithms, shaping strategies and policies for various tasks. This includes exploring algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Q-learning.

- **Learning Resources:** My approach combines a mix of **online tutorials** and **structured courses on Coursera** to build foundational skills, supplemented by reading **research papers** to understand the latest advancements and deepen my theoretical knowledge.
